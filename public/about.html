<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name's Buachompoo Buaphuech you guys can call me in short Yuyee.
I was born and raised in Thailand. I hold a bachelor's degree in Airline Business.
I really want to find a new challenges and I realized that I like to create something and when I saw people create something I was like "Wow, how did they do that. I want to do the same as they did". 
And when I was young, I enjoyed when I learn on Computer class.
So this is why I decided to learn about Coding.
I am so excited when I learning coding and I really enjoy it. :)</p>
